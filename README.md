Another revision project that how it creates a level-up experience of interaction with any website/application. This project is about DOM manipulation and several EVENTS of javascript.

▶️Some key points about DOM :-

🔹DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript: The DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page as a hierarchical tree of objects. It allows programs, especially JavaScript, to access and manipulate the content, structure, and styling of HTML or XML documents.

🔹Document Structure: The DOM views an HTML document as a tree structure where each node in the tree represents a part of the document. Nodes can be elements, attributes, text, etc.

🔹DOM Manipulation: JavaScript can interact with and modify the DOM in real-time, allowing web pages to be dynamic and interactive.

Key Features:

🔹Dynamic: The DOM can be modified after the page has been loaded. This is what allows for interactivity, animations, or updating content without refreshing the page (e.g., using AJAX).

🔹Platform and Language Independent: The DOM itself is a standardized model and can be manipulated by any programming language, though JavaScript is the most commonly used.

🔹Standardization: The DOM is standardized by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and is used across modern web browsers. This ensures consistency in how web pages are represented and manipulated by JavaScript.



▶️Some info. about EVENTS :-

JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that trigger code execution, typically in response to user interactions or browser events. Common events include:

🔹Mouse Events: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove.

🔹Keyboard Events: keydown, keyup.

🔹Form Events: submit, focus, blur, change, input.

🔹Window Events: load, resize, scroll.

🔹Clipboard Events: copy, cut, paste.

🔹Media Events: play, pause, ended.

🔹Touch Events: touchstart, touchmove, touchend (for mobile devices).

JavaScript uses the addEventListener() method to bind events to elements, and the event object provides useful information like event type and target. Events allow dynamic, interactive web pages.
